### Introduction

[Ajenti](http://ajenti.org/)  is an open source, web-based control panel that can be used for a large variety of server management tasks. The add-on package called Ajenti V allows you to manage multiple websites from the same control panel. By now you should have Ajenti and Ajenti V installed.

In this tutorial we will install a WordPress blog, using the tools Ajenti V provides.

For this tutorial, you will need:

-   A registered domain name that resolves to the Droplet with Ajenti and Ajenti V installed (example.com  is used throughout this tutorial)
-   Ajenti and Ajenti V installed from  [How to Install the Ajenti Control Panel and Ajenti V on Ubuntu 14.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-ajenti-control-panel-and-ajenti-v-on-ubuntu-14-04)

## [](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/installing-wordpress-on-ajenti-v#step-1-configuring-wordpress)Step 1 — Configuring WordPress

In your browser, browse to your Ajenti control panel such as  `https://panel.example.com/`, and log into it using the admin account you created when installing Ajenti and Ajenti V. In the sidebar to the right, under the  **Web**  section, click  **Websites**. The first time it may give you a notice that it is not active yet, just click the  **Enable**  button to allow Ajenti V to make the necessary config changes.

There will be a section called  **New Website**. Under that there is a  **Name**  text field. You can type anything you want to identify your website with in there. Click the  **Create**  button, and you will notice your website is now listed under the  **Websites**  section. Click  **Manage**  next to your website.

Under the  **Website Files**  section, change  `/srv/new-website`  to any directory, for example  `/srv/example.com`. Press the  **Set**  button, and then press the  **Create Directory**  button. Remember this directory. You will need to upload files to it soon.

Under the  **General**  section, uncheck the  **Maintenance mode**  setting. Then click  **Apply changes**  at the bottom of the page.

At the top of the page click on the  **Domains**  tab. Press the  **Add**  button, and type your domain name such as  `example.com`  in the text field that appears, then click the  **Apply Changes**  button.

Click the  **Advanced**  tab now, and in the  **Custom configuration**  box, enter the following:

```
# This order might seem weird - this is attempted to match last if rules below fail.
location / {
	try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
}

# Add trailing slash to */wp-admin requests.
rewrite /wp-admin$ $scheme://$host$uri/ permanent;

# Directives to send expires headers and turn off 404 error logging.
location ~* ^.+\.(ogg|ogv|svg|svgz|eot|otf|woff|mp4|ttf|rss|atom|jpg|jpeg|gif|png|ico|zip|tgz|gz|rar|bz2|doc|xls|exe|ppt|tar|mid|midi|wav|bmp|rtf)$ {
       access_log off; log_not_found off; expires max;
}

location = /favicon.ico {
	log_not_found off;
	access_log off;
}
location = /robots.txt {
	allow all;
	log_not_found off;
	access_log off;
}
# Deny all attempts to access hidden files such as .htaccess, .htpasswd, .DS_Store (Mac).
# Keep logging the requests to parse later (or to pass to firewall utilities such as fail2ban)
location ~ /\. {
	deny all;
}
# Deny access to any files with a .php extension in the uploads directory
# Works in sub-directory installs and also in multisite network
# Keep logging the requests to parse later (or to pass to firewall utilities such as fail2ban)
location ~* /(?:uploads|files)/.*\.php$ {
	deny all;
}
```

Click  **Apply changes**.

Next, click the  **Content**  tab on the top. In the dropdown menu select  **PHP FastCGI**, and click  **Create**. Click the  **Advanced**  menu under the new PHP entry, and enter the following content in  **Custom configuration**. Note this is not the same  **Custom configuration**  as the previous step.

```
try_files $uri =404;
fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
```

Click  **Apply Changes**.

Browse to the  **MySQL**  tab. Under the  **Databases**  section, enter a name for your database, this can be anything. It will be referenced later in the tutorial as  `database_name`. Click  **Create**. Now under the  **Users**  section, you can just click  **Create**  and use the automatically generated Name and Password provided, or you can use your own. The username and password will be referenced later as  `db_user`  and  `db_password`, respectively. When you are finished, click  **Apply Changes**. Remember the database name, user, and password. You will need them later in this tutorial to finish setting up WordPress.

## [](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/installing-wordpress-on-ajenti-v#step-2-uploading-the-files)Step 2 — Uploading the Files

Before you can unpack the WordPress files, you need to install the zip utilities. In the sidebar, under  **Tools**, click  **Terminal**. Click  **New**, and click the black box that appears. Type the following into the terminal:

```
apt-get install zip unzip
```

When the process completes, click the  **X**  next to  **Terminal 0**  at the top of the page.

Go back to the  **Websites**  section again now, and click  **Manage**  next to your website. Then go to the  **General**  tab of your website. Under the  **Automatic Downloader**  section, input  `http://wordpress.org/latest.zip`, then press  **Download and Unpack**. A terminal will appear. When it finishes unpacking you can exit the terminal by clicking the  **X**  next to  **Terminal 0**  at the top of the page.

Back under the  **Tools**  section in the sidebar, click  **File Manager**. Navigate to the directory you previously created in the  `/srv/`  directory by clicking the folder names. Inside there should be a directory named  `wordpress`  that was created when the Automatic Downloader unpacked the WordPress files. Open it and select all the files, like so:

![Select Files in /srv/example.com/wordpress](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/ajenti_ajenti_v_ubuntu1404/ajenti-wordpress-selectall.png)

Then press the  **Cut**  option in the toolbar at the top of the screen.

!["Cut" the WordPress Files](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/ajenti_ajenti_v_ubuntu1404/ajenti-wordpress-cutfiles.png)

Navigate back to your directory in the  `/srv/`  directory such as  `/srv/example.com`, and paste all the files in the root of the directory. You can then delete the empty  `wordpress`  folder. It may take a while for it to paste all the files, so be patient.

Now all the WordPress files are in the root of your website. We can now continue to the next step.

Browse to your domain name such as  `http://example.com`  in your web browser. You will be greeted by the initial WordPress installation page. Select your language in the selection field and click  **Continue**, then click  **Let’s go!**.

In the database name field, change  `wordpress`  to the  `database_name`  you picked earlier in the tutorial. Also provide the database username and password you decided on earlier in the tutorial.

**Database host**  should be left as  `localhost`.  **Table Prefix**  can be left as  `wp_`, but changing this from its default value might make your installation more secure from certain MySQL attacks. Consider changing it to something like  `blog_`  or even just something random as long as it’s followed by the  `_`  character. Keep it relatively short — no more than 5 characters or so.

Now you can click  **Run the install**, and WordPress will finish installing! You will be prompted to fill in a bit more site information such as the title and your admin credentials. Fill these in as you see fit.

You should now have a functional WordPress website installed on your Ajenti control panel.
