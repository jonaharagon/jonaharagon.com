## Introduction

phpMyAdmin is a free, web-facing control panel that can access and edit MySQL databases hosted on your server. It integrates with all existing and future databases on your Ajenti server automatically.

## [](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/installing-phpmyadmin-on-ajenti-v#step-1-creating-the-website-in-ajenti-v)Step 1 — Creating the Website in Ajenti V

Before installing phpMyAdmin, you need to create the website for it in Ajenti.

In your browser, browse to your Ajenti control panel at  `https://panel.example.com:8000`  (replacing  [example.com](http://example.com/)  with your domain name), and log in. In the sidebar to the right, under the  **Web**  section, click  **Websites**.

Under the  **New Website**  section there is a  **Name**  text field, type  `phpMyAdmin`  and click the  **Create**  button. Under the  **Websites**  section on that same page, click  **Manage**  next to the new  `phpMyAdmin`  line. On the page that appears, uncheck the box next to  **Maintenance mode**. In the  **Website Files**  section below that, change  **Path**  from  `/srv/new-website`  to  `/srv/phpMyAdmin`. Press the  **Set**  button next to that text field. Click  **Apply Changes**  at the bottom of the screen.

At the top of that page, click the  **Domains**  tab. Click  **Add**  and replace  `example.com`  with  `phpmyadmin.your_domain_name`. Click  **Apply Changes**  at the bottom of the screen.

Now click the  **Content**  tab. Change the dropdown box to  `PHP FastCGI`  and click  **Create**. This basically tells Ajenti to enable PHP for this website.

Click  **Apply Changes**  at the bottom of the screen. Configuration should now be complete. You should now be able to install phpMyAdmin.

To install phpMyAdmin, first browse to  [www.phpmyadmin.net/downloads](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/downloads/)  and download the latest version of phpMyAdmin in a  `.zip`  file format, shown highlighted in blue in the screenshot below.

![Download the latest .zip version of phpMyAdmin](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/ajenti_ajenti_v_ubuntu1404/ajenti-phpMyAdmin-zipfile.png)

Back in the Ajenti control panel, browse to  **File Manager**  in the sidebar. Use the File Manager to browse to  `/srv`. At the bottom of the page there is an  **Upload**  section. Click the  **Choose File**  button, and select the phpMyAdmin zip file you downloaded. After it finishes uploading, click the newly added file, named something like  `phpMyAdmin-x.x.xx-all-languages.zip`. In the modal box that appears, click the  **Unpack**  button (highlighted in blue in the screenshot below).

![Click the Unpack button](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/ajenti_ajenti_v_ubuntu1404/ajenti-phpMyAdmin-directory.png)

When it finishes, click the  **X**  button next to  **Terminal 0**  at the top of the screen. You should be taken back to the File Manager, and there should be a folder named something similar to  `phpMyAdmin-x.x.xx-all-languages`. Click the menu button to the right of that folder.

![Click the folder's menu](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/ajenti_ajenti_v_ubuntu1404/ajenti-phpMyAdmin-menu.png)

In the  **Name**  text box, rename the folder to  `phpMyAdmin`, and click  **Save**.

We’re going to cover setting up a database in Ajenti, so you can login to phpMyAdmin. If you already have a database and login, feel free to skip ahead to step 4.

In the Ajenti control panel, in the sidebar there is a section called  **Software**. Directly below that is a menu option named  **MySQL**. Click that to access the MySQL control panel in Ajenti.

![MySQL database controls](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/ajenti_ajenti_v_ubuntu1404/ajenti-phpMyAdmin-mysql.png)

Under the  **Databases**  section, click the  **Create**  button. There you will be able to enter a name for your database. This can be anything you’d like. It won’t be seen by anybody but you.

The rest of the sections may automatically populate with default databases and users. This is fine, and you don’t need to touch them. Under the  **Users**  section, click the  **Create**  button. The  **Username**  and  **Password**  fields can be whatever you want, this is what you will login to phpMyAdmin with, so be sure to remember it or write it down. In the  **Hostname**  field, enter  `localhost`.

That should be it, now we can start using phpMyAdmin.

To access the phpMyAdmin web interface, browse to  `phpmyadmin.your_domain_name`  in your web browser. For the  **Username**  and  **Password**  fields, enter the credentials of your MySQL user, and press  **Go**.
