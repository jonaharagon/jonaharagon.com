## Contact Me

The best way to get in touch with me is via email at jonah@triplebit.net.

## Instant Messaging

I am not generally available via IM and will likely not respond to any message requests in a timely manner, but if you do receive a message from me, I use the following accounts:

- Matrix: [`@jonah:neat.chat`](https://matrix.to/#/@jonah:neat.chat)
- SimpleX: [QR Code](/simplex)

If you receive a message claiming to be me from an account not listed here, please email me to confirm that account's identity.

## Social Media

- Mastodon: [@jonah@neat.computer](https://mastodon.neat.computer/@jonah)
- YouTube: [@jonaharagon](https://youtube.com/@jonaharagon)
- Reddit: [u/jonaharagon](https://www.reddit.com/user/JonahAragon)
- LinkedIn: [in/jonaharagon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonaharagon/)

## Code

Most of my public contributions and discussions for various open source projects, including Privacy Guides, can be found on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/jonaharagon).

I currently sign my Git commits with SSH:

```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJUp+Gi8ZpTDDbZC+GY+3QnFfxkI9rAu07bceyoHDp9O
```

Fingerprint: `SHA256:oJSBSFgpWl4g+IwjL96Ya8ocGfI7r6VKnQw+257pZZ0`

I previously signed commits with the GPG key `6325C3370B70177138ABF3086A957C9A9A9429F7`.

## PGP

You may send me an encrypted email via PGP. You should not rely on this for serious communication: I store my secret key on multiple devices and no longer utilize hardware keys for convenience's sake. Email is also inherently neither secure nor private by design, and PGP does not change that. You may email me at your own risk, but you **should** message me on Matrix or Signal instead.

My public key for most of my email addresses is [`3E98167560BD65BCAFDC167075437E0B682D1FED`](/pgp/3E98167560BD65BCAFDC167075437E0B682D1FED.asc). I do not distribute my full public key to avoid sharing my email addresses, and if you have a more complete version of this public key I would kindly ask you to not upload it to a public key server. If you know my email address, you can obtain my public key via [WKD](https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD), or you can ask me for a copy.

If you use this key, please email me with Inline PGP instead of PGP/MIME (unless you are sending an attachment) because it is more compatible with the mobile clients I use. Otherwise, if you send me a PGP/MIME encrypted message you may have to wait until I return to my desk.

My Proton Mail account will not decrypt messages using the key above, and instead uses a variety of Proton-managed keys depending on the address, including:

- `6bce5ff2d7dbd71383c0cf82a48269eea7d2b037`
- `f7da647d0bc2f586a7abf8ffc309038e9452c6c6`
- `55dc5d132a1c5a084725690764c0f0c859a2d781`
- `b6afabbae12fc8fffecc5c83a3180ab6934e8c53`

Again, you may obtain these keys via WKD if you know the associated email address.

I previously used [`6325C3370B70177138ABF3086A957C9A9A9429F7`](/pgp/6325C3370B70177138ABF3086A957C9A9A9429F7.asc), but no longer do.
