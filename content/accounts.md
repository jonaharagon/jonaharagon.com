## Code

Most of my public contributions and discussions for various open source projects, including Privacy Guides, can be found on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/jonaharagon), however my personal projects are now hosted on [sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~jonaharagon/).

I currently sign my Git commits with SSH:

```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJUp+Gi8ZpTDDbZC+GY+3QnFfxkI9rAu07bceyoHDp9O
```

Fingerprint: `SHA256:oJSBSFgpWl4g+IwjL96Ya8ocGfI7r6VKnQw+257pZZ0`

I previously signed commits with the GPG key `0x6325c3370b70177138abf3086a957c9a9a9429f7`, but I no longer use GPG for any purpose.
