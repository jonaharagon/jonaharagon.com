If you want to install Mojave from scratch, or you need to install it regularly or on multiple Macs, using a USB installer is the way to go for an easy installation. This method requires no third-party software, just a Mac that already has macOS installed and some basic Disk Utility and Terminal usage.

## Erasing the USB Drive

Before we can put macOS on the drive, we'll need to erase it and format it properly. Be sure you're using a drive 8GB or larger.

  1. Open Disk Utility
  2. Click View > Show All Devices (Command + 2)
  3. Select the USB drive in the sidebar (not the partition!) as shown below, and click Erase (Shift + Command + E) in the header bar.

This step will erase all the data on your USB drive! Be sure you're using a blank or disposable drive before erasing it.

  4. Enter a name for your drive, choose "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)" as the format, and "GUID Partition Map" as the scheme. Click Erase.

## Downloading macOS

macOS can be downloaded in the App Store on any other Mac device (which you should already be using for this guide anyways).

Mojave: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-mojave/id1398502828?ls=1&mt=12

High Sierra: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-high-sierra/id1246284741?ls=1&mt=12

Sierra: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-sierra/id1127487414?ls=1&mt=12

El Capitan: https://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1147835434?ls=1&mt=12

## Installing macOS

Open **Terminal** and issue the following command to list all the mounted drives:

```
ls /Volumes/
```

Confirm your USB drive is listed as whatever you named it. In the example above, I named mine "DATA", so `DATA` is shown listed after that command. Make note of that name.

To install macOS Mojave to your USB drive, issue the following command in Terminal:

```
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Mojave.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/DATA
```

Before pressing enter, replace `/Volumes/DATA` in the command above with `/Volumes/` followed by the name of your device we just found. If your USB device was named `ALPHA` you'd replace it with `/Volumes/ALPHA` here, for example.

The command for High Sierra is similar:

```
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ High\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/DATA
```

Again, replacing `DATA` with your own USB information.

The commands for Sierra and El Capitan are slightly modified:

```
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/DATA --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app
```

```
sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/DATA --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app
```

Note these include the `--applicationpath` flag with the path to the downloaded installer repeated.

**If you are creating your USB drive on a Mac using Sierra or earlier**, and you are creating a Mojave or High Sierra USB installer, you must include the `--applicationpath` flag in the same way it's shown for the Sierra and El Capitan examples.

## Booting Up

That should be it! To use your installer, turn on the Mac you'd like to install macOS on, and immediately hold the Option key to display the [startup boot manager](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202796):

Then, navigate to your USB drive with the arrow keys and press enter to boot.
