I create educational resources for average people to understand the importance of privacy and security on the internet, and take back control over their digital lives.

You may know me from work on the [Techlore](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3KeV6Ui_4CZRb5Z4qZjsIGZrUWbDc3Mn) YouTube channel, including the [Techlore Talks](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27252550/) podcast I co-host, and the [Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org) non-profit website which I founded and am a lead contributor to.
