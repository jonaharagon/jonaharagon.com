title: Privacy Guides Archive
---
I've written a number of new/original articles for [Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org), which are saved/timestamped here for posterity. These articles were intended to be living documents updated as information changed, which will not be the case here. Therefore, if you are looking for actual privacy advice you would be better served by the current content on [privacyguides.org](https://www.privacyguides.org). This category of posts mainly serves as an archive of my own writing work.

Of course, this archive will not be a complete record of everything I have authored for the site:

- [Every Pull Request I've authored for Privacy Guides](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pulls?q=is:pr+author:jonaharagon)
- [Every Pull Request I've authored prior to September 2020](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/pulls?q=is:pr+author:jonaharagon)

In addition, I have done a significant amount of writing and editing on pull requests which were authored by other people, which will not appear on those lists; and some articles I have authored were cross-posted to my personal [blog](/posts/)—such as my [introduction to threat modeling](http://localhost:1313/posts/threat-modeling/)—and will not appear on this page.
